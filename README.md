# JWKS-SERVER
This JWKS Server was created as a project for my CSCE3550 Cybersecurity course.
Possible need to "npm install node-fetch@2" if there is an error node-fetch newest version doesn't work well, so version two is used.

side-note npm install can be used to download all of the needed dependecies beyond node-fetch.

run the server using command line in the directory that you want the private keys and JWKS to be stored. The server will create them there.
CMD: "node ./server.js"
