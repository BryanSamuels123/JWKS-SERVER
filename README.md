# JWKS-SERVER
This JWKS Server was created as a project for my CSCE3550 Cybersecurity course.
Possible need to "npm install node-fetch@2" if there is an error node-fetch newest version doesn't work well, so version two is used.

run the server using command line in the directory that you want the private keys and JWKS to be stored. The server will create them there.
